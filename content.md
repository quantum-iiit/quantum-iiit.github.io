### [Quantum Seminar] Victor Albert—Quantum error correction: a guided tour (final part, online-only)

<img align="left" width="140" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0e8ca09-51a0-4d3e-b2fd-243ee134d344" />

 -->

I present my QIP2025 tutorial, which provides an overview of quantum error correction circa Spring 2025.

What to expect from this series (based on the speaker's slide; co-written with ChatGPT)?

The speaker is tentatively expected to offer a broad overview of quantum error correction, focusing on unifying ideas that link information theory, geometry, and many-body physics. Starting from classical coding concepts, the speaker may introduce key quantum ingredients such as the stabilizer formalism and protection against different types of errors, before touching on CSS codes, homological viewpoints, and representative families such as surface and quantum LDPC codes. Possible extensions beyond qubits and brief discussion of practical issues like decoding, fault tolerance, and approximate error correction may also be included, along with pointers to wider connections with quantum matter and near-term hardware.

### [Quantum Seminar] Alper Cakan—[Multi-Copy Security in Unclonable Cryptography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12626) (presented online)

<img align="left" width="140" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a67f73cf-02ca-467a-8cd8-5b0a7717f43c" />

 -->



Unclonable cryptography leverages the quantum no-cloning principle to copy-protect cryptographic functionalities. While most existing works address the basic single-copy security, the stronger notion of multi-copy security remains largely unexplored.
We introduce a generic compiler that upgrades collusion-resistant unclonable primitives to achieve multi-copy security, assuming only one-way functions. Using this framework, we obtain the first multi-copy secure constructions of public-key quantum money (termed quantum coins), single-decryptor encryption, unclonable encryption, and more. We also introduce an extended notion of quantum coins, called upgradable quantum coins, which allow weak (almost-public) verification under weaker assumptions and can be upgraded to full public verification under stronger assumptions by the bank simply publishing additional classical information.
Along the way, we give a generic compiler that upgrades single-copy secure single-decryptor encryption to a collusion-resistant one, assuming the existence of functional encryption, and construct the first multi-challenge secure unclonable encryption scheme, which we believe are of independent interest.

## Pipeline


### [Quantum Seminar] Joseph Slote—[Quantum parallelization and the Moore–Nilsson conjecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04411) (presented online)

<img align="left" width="140" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f6142b5-72ea-47db-87bb-c08d48cae542" />

Parallelization is a significant challenge in quantum algorithms due to physical constraints like no-cloning. This is vividly illustrated by the conjecture of Moore and Nilsson from their seminal work on quantum circuit complexity (SIAM J. Comput. ’01): unitaries of a deceptively simple form—controlled-unitary “staircases”—require circuits of minimum depth Ω(n). If true, this lower bound would represent a major break from classical parallelism and prove a quantum-native analogue of the famous NC = P conjecture.

In this talk we'll develop a quantum precomputation technique and use it to settle the Moore–Nilsson conjecture in the negative by compressing all circuits in the class to depth O(log n), which is the best possible. We'll also give polynomial depth improvements for certain generalizations of Moore–Nilsson circuits and discuss open problems in the area.

### [Quantum Seminar] Andrew Huang—[Separating Quantum and Classical Advice with Good Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09385) (presented online)

We show an unconditional classical oracle separation between the class of languages that can be verified using a quantum proof (𝖰𝖬𝖠) and the class of languages that can be verified with a classical proof (𝖰𝖢𝖬𝖠). Compared to the recent work of Bostanci, Haferkamp, Nirkhe, and Zhandry (STOC 2026), our proof is conceptually and technically simpler, and readily extends to other oracle separations. In particular, our techniques yield the first unconditional classical oracle separation between the class of languages that can be decided with quantum advice (𝖡𝖰𝖯/𝗊𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒) and the class of languages that can be decided with classical advice (𝖡𝖰𝖯/𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒), improving on the quantum oracle separation of Aaronson and Kuperberg (CCC 2007) and the classically-accessible classical oracle separation of Li, Liu, Pelecanos and Yamakawa (ITCS 2024).
Our oracles are based on the code intersection problem introduced by Yamakawa and Zhandry (FOCS 2022), combined with codes that have extremely good list-recovery properties.

### [Quantum Seminar] Liang Mao—[Random unitaries that conserve energy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08448) (presented online)

<img align="left" width="140" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ac9c59b-2c04-43fe-85f3-aab40a4ff9fb" />

Random unitaries sampled from the Haar measure serve as fundamental models for generic quantum many-body dynamics. Under standard cryptographic assumptions, recent works have constructed polynomial-size quantum circuits that are computationally indistinguishable from Haar-random unitaries, establishing the concept of pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs). While PRUs have found broad implications in many-body physics, they fail to capture the energy conservation that governs physical systems. In this work, we investigate the computational complexity of generating PRUs that conserve energy under a fixed and known Hamiltonian H. We provide an efficient construction of energy-conserving PRUs when H is local and commuting with random coefficients. Conversely, we prove that for certain translationally invariant one-dimensional H, there exists an efficient quantum algorithm that can distinguish truly random energy-conserving unitaries from any polynomial-size quantum circuit. This establishes that energy-conserving PRUs cannot exist for these Hamiltonians. Furthermore, we prove that determining whether energy-conserving PRUs exist for a given family of one-dimensional local Hamiltonians is an undecidable problem. Our results reveal an unexpected computational barrier that fundamentally separates the generation of generic random unitaries from those obeying the basic physical constraint of energy conservation.

### [Quantum Seminar] Jose Carrasco—[The abelian state hidden subgroup problem: Learning stabilizer groups and beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15770) (presented online)

<img align="left" width="140" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b50afe2a-387b-4165-8e52-c9029cf8f4f6" />

Identifying the symmetry properties of quantum states is a central theme in quantum information theory and quantum many-body physics. In this work, we investigate quantum learning problems in which the goal is to identify a hidden symmetry of an unknown quantum state. Building on the recent formulation of the state hidden subgroup problem (StateHSP), we focus on abelian groups and develop an efficient quantum algorithm that learns any hidden symmetry subgroup using a generalized form of Fourier sampling. We showcase the versatility of the approach in three concrete applications: These are learning (i) qubit and qudit stabilizer groups, (ii) cuts along which a state is unentangled, and (iii) hidden translation symmetries. Through these applications, we reveal that well-known quantum learning primitives, such as Bell sampling and Bell difference sampling, are in fact special cases of Fourier sampling. Our results highlight the broad potential of the StateHSP framework for symmetry-based quantum learning tasks.

### [Quantum Seminar] Chinmay Nirkhe—[Separating QMA and QCMA with a classical oracle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09551) (presented online)



<img align="left" width="140" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/051937da-e69f-41cc-a4c4-55504a65a115" />

 -->


We construct a classical oracle proving that, in a relativized setting, the set of languages decidable by an efficient quantum verifier with a quantum witness (QMA) is strictly bigger than those decidable with access only to a classical witness (QCMA). The separating classical oracle we construct is for a decision problem we coin spectral Forrelation -- the oracle describes two subsets of the boolean hypercube, and the computational task is to decide if there exists a quantum state whose standard basis measurement distribution is well supported on one subset while its Fourier basis measurement distribution is well supported on the other subset. This is equivalent to estimating the spectral norm of a "Forrelation" matrix between two sets that are accessible through membership queries.Our lower bound derives from a simple observation that a query algorithm with a classical witness can be run multiple times to generate many samples from a distribution, while a quantum witness is a "use once" object. This observation allows us to reduce proving a QCMA lower bound to proving a sampling hardness result which does not simultaneously prove a QMA lower bound. To prove said sampling hardness result for QCMA, we observe that quantum access to the oracle can be compressed by expressing the problem in terms of bosons -- a novel "second quantization" perspective on compressed oracle techniques, which may be of independent interest. Using this compressed perspective on the sampling problem, we prove the sampling hardness result, completing the proof.

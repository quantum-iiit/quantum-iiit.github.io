### [Quantum Talk] Aryaman Kolhe—On Quantum Computation Using Bias-Preserving Gates (in-person)

<img align="left" width="140" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57584f93-28ff-435e-82fa-36bc0b42fece" />

Certain types of quantum computing platforms, such as those realized using Rydberg atoms or Kerr-cat qubits, are natively more susceptible to Pauli-Z noise than Pauli-X noise, or vice versa. On such hardware, it is useful to ensure that computations use only gates that maintain the Z-bias (or X-bias) in the noise. This is so that quantum error-correcting codes tailored for biased-noise models can be used to provide fault-tolerance on these platforms. In this paper, we follow up on the recent work of Fellous-Asiani et al. (npj Quantum Inf., 2025) in studying the structure and properties of bias-preserving gates. Our main contributions are threefold: (1) We give a novel characterization of Z-bias-preserving gates based on their decomposition as a linear combination of Pauli operators. (2) We show that any Z-bias-preserving gate can be approximated arbitrarily well using only gates from the set ${X,R_z(\theta),\mathsf{CNOT},\mathsf{CCNOT}}$, where $\theta$ is any irrational multiple of $2\pi$. (3) We prove, by drawing a connection with coherence resource theory, that any $Z$-bias-preserving logical operator acting on the logical qubits of a Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) code can be realized by applying $Z$-bias-preserving gates on the physical qubits. Along the way, we also demonstrate that $Z$-bias-preserving gates are far from being universal for quantum computation.

### [Quantum Seminar] Chinmay Nirkhe—[Separating QMA and QCMA with a classical oracle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09551) (presented online)



<img align="left" width="140" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/051937da-e69f-41cc-a4c4-55504a65a115" />

 -->


We construct a classical oracle proving that, in a relativized setting, the set of languages decidable by an efficient quantum verifier with a quantum witness (QMA) is strictly bigger than those decidable with access only to a classical witness (QCMA). The separating classical oracle we construct is for a decision problem we coin spectral Forrelation -- the oracle describes two subsets of the boolean hypercube, and the computational task is to decide if there exists a quantum state whose standard basis measurement distribution is well supported on one subset while its Fourier basis measurement distribution is well supported on the other subset. This is equivalent to estimating the spectral norm of a "Forrelation" matrix between two sets that are accessible through membership queries.Our lower bound derives from a simple observation that a query algorithm with a classical witness can be run multiple times to generate many samples from a distribution, while a quantum witness is a "use once" object. This observation allows us to reduce proving a QCMA lower bound to proving a sampling hardness result which does not simultaneously prove a QMA lower bound. To prove said sampling hardness result for QCMA, we observe that quantum access to the oracle can be compressed by expressing the problem in terms of bosons -- a novel "second quantization" perspective on compressed oracle techniques, which may be of independent interest. Using this compressed perspective on the sampling problem, we prove the sampling hardness result, completing the proof.

### [Quantum Seminar] Kaushik Chakraborty—[Certified Randomness and Classical Verifier Position Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03982) (presented online)

Gate-based quantum computers hold enormous potential to accelerate classically intractable computational tasks. Random circuit sampling (RCS) is the only known task that has been able to be experimentally demonstrated using current-day NISQ devices. However, for a long time, it remained challenging to demonstrate the quantum utility of RCS on practical problems. Recently, leveraging RCS, an interactive protocol generating certified randomness was demonstrated using a trapped ion quantum computer, advancing the practical utility of near-term gate-based quantum computers. In this work, we establish a strong connection between certified randomness and another quantum computation classical communication primitive, classically verifiable position verification (CVPV), which circumvents the practical challenges that may arise from long-distance quantum communications. We provide a new generic compiler that can convert any single-round proof of quantumness based certified randomness protocol into a secure classical communication-based position verification scheme. Later, we extend our compiler to different types of multi-round protocols. Notably, our compiler can be applied to any multi-round certified randomness protocol that can be analyzed using the entropy accumulation theorem, making its applicability very general. Moreover, we show that CVPV is equivalent to a relaxed variant of certified randomness that we define. We instantiate each of our compilers using existing certified randomness protocols. In particular, building on the work of Aaronson and Hung (STOC '23), we give a NISQ-friendly instantiation based on RCS, which was experimentally demonstrated by Liu et al.. Hence, we show that CVPV is another application within reach of NISQ devices.

### [Quantum Seminar] Shota Yamada—[A Unified Approach to Quantum Key Leasing with a Classical Lessor](https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/1871) (presented online)

<img align="left" width="140" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13b091c0-9e08-484a-b84e-1ad6a66c4092" />

Secure key leasing allows a cryptographic key to be leased as a quantum state in such a way that the key can later be revoked in a verifiable manner. In this work, we propose a modular framework for constructing secure key leasing with a classical-lessor, where the lessor is entirely classical and, in particular, the quantum secret key can be both leased and revoked using only classical communication. Based on this framework, we obtain classical-lessor secure key leasing schemes for public-key encryption (PKE), pseudorandom function (PRF), and digital signature. We adopt the strong security notion known as security against verification key revealing attacks (VRA security) proposed by Kitagawa et al. (Eurocrypt 2025) into the classical-lessor setting, and we prove that all three of our schemes satisfy this notion under the learning with errors assumption. Our PKE scheme improves upon the previous construction by Goyal et al. (Eurocrypt 2025), and our PRF and digital signature schemes are respectively the first PRF and digital signature with classical-lessor secure key leasing property.

### [Quantum Seminar] Aparna Gupte—[Classical Obfuscation of Quantum Circuits via Publicly-Verifiable QFHE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08400) (presented online)

<img align="left" width="140" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8d5bd2c-32fe-4f72-8dcc-880584246079" /> 

<!-- <img width="455" height="483" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8d5bd2c-32fe-4f72-8dcc-880584246079" /> -->



A classical obfuscator for quantum circuits is a classical program that, given the classical description of a quantum circuit Q, outputs the classical description of a functionally equivalent quantum circuit Q' that hides as much as possible about Q. Previously, the only known feasibility result for classical obfuscation of quantum circuits (Bartusek and Malavolta, ITCS 2022) was limited to "nul" security, which is only meaningful for circuits that always reject. On the other hand, if the obfuscator is allowed to compile the quantum circuit Q into a quantum state |Q'>, there exist feasibility results for obfuscating much more expressive classes of circuits: All pseudo-deterministic quantum circuits (Bartusek, Kitagawa, Nishimaki and Yamakawa, STOC 2023, Bartusek, Brakerski and Vaikuntanathan, STOC 2024), and even all unitaries (Huang and Tang, FOCS 2025).

We show that (relative to a classical oracle) there exists a classical obfuscator for all pseudo-deterministic quantum circuits. As our main technical step, we give the first construction of a compact quantum fully-homomorphic encryption (QFHE) scheme that supports public verification of (pseudo-deterministic) quantum evaluation, relative to a classical oracle.

To construct our QFHE scheme, we improve on an approach introduced by Bartusek, Kitagawa, Nishimaki and Yamakawa (STOC 2023), which previously required ciphertexts that are both quantum and non-compact due to a heavy use of quantum coset states and their publicly-verifiable properties. As part of our core technical contribution, we introduce new techniques for analyzing coset states that can be generated "on the fly", by proving new cryptographic properties of the one-shot signature scheme of Shmueli and Zhandry (CRYPTO 2025). Our techniques allow us to produce QFHE ciphertexts that are purely classical, compact, and publicly-verifiable. This additionally yields the first classical verification of quantum computation protocol for BQP that simultaneously satisfies blindness and public-verifiability.

This is based on joint work with James Bartusek, Saachi Mutreja and Omri Shmueli.

### [Quantum Seminar] Alexander Schmidhuber—[Hamiltonian Decoded Quantum Interferometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07913) (presented online)

 -->



We introduce Hamiltonian Decoded Quantum Interferometry (HDQI), a quantum algorithm that utilizes coherent Bell measurements and the symplectic representation of the Pauli group to reduce Gibbs sampling and Hamiltonian optimization to classical decoding. For a signed Pauli Hamiltonian H and any degree-ℓ polynomial P, HDQI prepares a purification of the density matrix ρP(H)∝P2(H) by solving a combination of two tasks: decoding ℓ errors on a classical code defined by H, and preparing a pilot state that encodes the anti-commutation structure of H. Choosing P(x) to approximate exp(−βx/2) yields Gibbs states at inverse temperature β; other choices prepare approximate ground states, microcanonical ensembles, and other spectral filters.
For local Hamiltonians, the corresponding decoding problem is that of LDPC codes. Preparing the pilot state is always efficient for commuting Hamiltonians, but highly non-trivial for non-commuting Hamiltonians. Nevertheless, we prove that this state admits an efficient matrix product state representation for Hamiltonians whose anti-commutation graph decomposes into connected components of logarithmic size.
We show that HDQI efficiently prepares Gibbs states at arbitrary temperatures for a class of physically motivated commuting Hamiltonians -- including the toric code and Haah's cubic code -- but we also develop a matching efficient classical algorithm for this task. For a non-commuting semiclassical spin glass and commuting stabilizer Hamiltonians with quantum defects, HDQI prepares Gibbs states up to a constant inverse-temperature threshold using polynomial quantum resources and quasi-polynomial classical pre-processing. These results position HDQI as a versatile algorithmic primitive and the first extension of Regev's reduction to non-abelian groups.

### [Quantum Seminar] Alper Cakan—[Multi-Copy Security in Unclonable Cryptography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12626) (presented online)

<img align="left" width="140" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a67f73cf-02ca-467a-8cd8-5b0a7717f43c" />

 -->



Unclonable cryptography leverages the quantum no-cloning principle to copy-protect cryptographic functionalities. While most existing works address the basic single-copy security, the stronger notion of multi-copy security remains largely unexplored.
We introduce a generic compiler that upgrades collusion-resistant unclonable primitives to achieve multi-copy security, assuming only one-way functions. Using this framework, we obtain the first multi-copy secure constructions of public-key quantum money (termed quantum coins), single-decryptor encryption, unclonable encryption, and more. We also introduce an extended notion of quantum coins, called upgradable quantum coins, which allow weak (almost-public) verification under weaker assumptions and can be upgraded to full public verification under stronger assumptions by the bank simply publishing additional classical information.
Along the way, we give a generic compiler that upgrades single-copy secure single-decryptor encryption to a collusion-resistant one, assuming the existence of functional encryption, and construct the first multi-challenge secure unclonable encryption scheme, which we believe are of independent interest.

### [Quantum Seminar] Liang Mao—[Random unitaries that conserve energy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08448) (presented online)

Random unitaries sampled from the Haar measure serve as fundamental models for generic quantum many-body dynamics. Under standard cryptographic assumptions, recent works have constructed polynomial-size quantum circuits that are computationally indistinguishable from Haar-random unitaries, establishing the concept of pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs). While PRUs have found broad implications in many-body physics, they fail to capture the energy conservation that governs physical systems. In this work, we investigate the computational complexity of generating PRUs that conserve energy under a fixed and known Hamiltonian H. We provide an efficient construction of energy-conserving PRUs when H is local and commuting with random coefficients. Conversely, we prove that for certain translationally invariant one-dimensional H, there exists an efficient quantum algorithm that can distinguish truly random energy-conserving unitaries from any polynomial-size quantum circuit. This establishes that energy-conserving PRUs cannot exist for these Hamiltonians. Furthermore, we prove that determining whether energy-conserving PRUs exist for a given family of one-dimensional local Hamiltonians is an undecidable problem. Our results reveal an unexpected computational barrier that fundamentally separates the generation of generic random unitaries from those obeying the basic physical constraint of energy conservation.

Resource theory provides a framework to quantitatively understand the amount of resource in a system and how it changes based on the operations performed on it. Standard resource theories in quantum information theory and thermodynamics typically assume unbounded computational capabilities for retrieving those resources. While this holds in theory, practical quantum devices are limited to efficient (poly-time) computation, which may significantly restrict the resources that can be obtained.
In this talk, we focus on the thermodynamic resource called ergotropy (erg), the maximum amount of work that can be extracted from a system. We introduce the notion of computational ergotropy and show how imposing these computational constraints would restrict the amount of work that can be extracted significantly (exponential separation).
Inspired by the concept of pseudo-entanglement, we introduce the notion of pseudo-ergotropy, where states that look like they yield maximal work to a computationally bounded observer are, in fact, easier to prepare. This work highlights that computational complexity is a critical resource that influences the operational capabilities of physical systems.

### [Quantum Seminar] Xiangling Xu—[Quantitative quantum soundness for all multipartite compiled nonlocal games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25145/) (presented online)

<img align="left" width="140" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d06667aa-b17b-45df-8bc4-f945d45ac943" />

Compiled nonlocal games transfer the power of Bell-type multi-prover tests into a single-device setting by replacing spatial separation with cryptography. Concretely, the KLVY compiler (STOC'23) maps any multi-prover game to an interactive single-prover protocol, using quantum homomorphic encryption. A crucial security property of such compilers is quantum soundness, which ensures that a dishonest quantum prover cannot exceed the original game's quantum value. For practical cryptographic implementations, this soundness must be quantitative, providing concrete bounds, rather than merely asymptotic. While quantitative quantum soundness has been established for the KLVY compiler in the bipartite case, it has only been shown asymptotically for multipartite games. This is a significant gap, as multipartite nonlocality exhibits phenomena with no bipartite analogue, and the difficulty of enforcing space-like separation makes single-device compilation especially compelling. This work closes this gap by showing the quantitative quantum soundness of the KLVY compiler for all multipartite nonlocal games. On the way, we introduce an NPA-like hierarchy for quantum instruments and prove its completeness, thereby characterizing correlations from operationally-non-signaling sequential strategies. We further develop novel geometric arguments for the decomposition of sequential strategies into their signaling and non-signaling parts, which might be of independent interest.

### [Quantum Seminar] Sayantan Chakraborty—[A robust and composable device-independent protocol for oblivious transfer using (fully) untrusted quantum devices in the bounded storage model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11283) (presented online)

<img align="left" width="140" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57584f93-28ff-435e-82fa-36bc0b42fece" />

<!-- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c4ec3062-0d9e-4c90-9a4a-c0568339d0d5) -->

We present a robust and composable device-independent (DI) quantum protocol between two parties for oblivious transfer (OT) using Magic Square devices in the bounded storage model in which the (honest and cheating) devices and parties have no long-term quantum memory. After a fixed constant (real-world) time interval, referred to as DELAY, the quantum states decohere completely. The adversary (cheating party), with full control over the devices, is allowed joint (non-IID) quantum operations on the devices, and there are no time and space complexity bounds placed on its powers. The running time of the honest parties is $\mathsf{polylog}(\lambda)$ (where $\lambda$ is the security parameter). Our protocol has negligible (in $\lambda$) correctness and security errors and can be implemented in the NISQ (Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum) era. By robustness, we mean that our protocol is correct even when devices are slightly off (by a small constant) from their ideal specification. This is an important property since small manufacturing errors in the real-world devices are inevitable. Our protocol is sequentially composable and, hence, can be used as a building block to construct larger protocols (including DI bit-commitment and DI secure multi-party computation) while still preserving correctness and security guarantees.None of the known DI protocols for OT in the literature are robust and secure against joint quantum attacks. This was a major open question in device-independent two-party distrustful cryptography, which we resolve.
We prove a parallel repetition theorem for a certain class of entangled games with a hybrid (quantum-classical) strategy to show the security of our protocol. The hybrid strategy helps to incorporate DELAY in our protocol. This parallel repetition theorem is a main technical contribution of our work.

### [Quantum Seminar] Alexandru Cojocaru—[Quantum Lifting Theorems in QROM and QRPM](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.09896v1) (presented online)

<!-- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c4ec3062-0d9e-4c90-9a4a-c0568339d0d5) -->

We give novel and tighter lifting theorems for security games in the quantum random oracle model (QROM), as well as in Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) settings such as the hybrid query model, the noisy oracle and the bounded-depth models. At the core of our main results lies a novel measure-and-reprogram framework that we call coherent reprogramming. This framework gives a tighter lifting theorem for query complexity problems.
Secondly, we provide a hybrid lifting theorem for hybrid algorithms that can perform both quantum and classical queries, as well as a lifting theorem for quantum algorithms with access to noisy oracles or bounded quantum depth.
Thirdly, we derive lifting theorems for establishing security in the quantum random permutation and ideal cipher models.
These theorems relate the success probability of an arbitrary quantum adversary to that of a classical algorithm making only a small number of classical queries.

### [Quantum Seminar] Pedro Barrios—[Quantum mechanics based on real numbers: A consistent description](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17307) (presented online)

<img align="left" width="140" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f81695a-1b29-4e82-8fd9-60b38bb0e72a" />

Complex numbers play a crucial role in quantum mechanics. However, their necessity remains debated: whether they are fundamental or merely convenient.
Recently, it was claimed that quantum mechanics based on real numbers can be experimentally falsified in the sense that any real-number formulation of quantum mechanics either becomes inconsistent with multipartite experiments or violates certain postulates. In this article we show that a physically motivated postulate about composite quantum systems allows to construct quantum mechanics based on real numbers that reproduces predictions for all multipartite quantum experiments. Thus, we argue that real-valued quantum mechanics cannot be falsified, and therefore the use of complex numbers is a matter of convenience.

We develop randomized quantum algorithms to simulate quantum collision models, also known as repeated interaction schemes, which provide a rich framework to model various open-system dynamics. The underlying technique involves composing time evolutions of simple Hamiltonians on a joint system environment space and intermittent tracing out of the environment degrees of freedom. This results in a unified framework where any near-term Hamiltonian simulation algorithm can be incorporated to implement an arbitrary number of such collisions on early fault-tolerant quantum computers.  In particular, using the correspondence between Lindbladian evolution and completely positive trace-preserving maps arising out of memoryless collisions, we provide an end-to-end quantum algorithm for simulating Lindbladian dynamics. Finally, we also develop a framework to efficiently simulate an arbitrary number of memory retaining collisions, i.e., where environments interact, leading to non-Markovian dynamics. Overall, our methods can leverage quantum collision models for both Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics on early fault-tolerant quantum computers, shedding light on the advantages and limitations of this framework.

The emerging quantum computing techniques are heavily assisted by classical computers and algorithms for their functioning. At the same time, there is a strong and growing interest in whether quantum effects can enhance the efficiency of already existing classical algorithms, such as deep learning. In this talk, I will discuss the quantum optimization technique called quantum annealing and how some of the problems within the field can be tackled using genetic algorithms and deep learning. I will also talk about applying classical-quantum hybrid neural networks to solve differential equations, with an example from the field of plasma simulations.

We prove that QMA where the verifier may also make a single non−collapsing measurement is equal to NEXP, resolving an open question of Aaronson. We show this is a corollary to a modified proof of QMA+=NEXP. At the core of many results inspired by Blier and Tapp is an unphysical property testing problem deciding whether a quantum state is close to an element of a fixed basis.

In this talk, we explore three contributions in QML relevant for near-term quantum devices. First, we introduce the Quantum Generative Adversarial Autoencoder (QGAA), a novel architecture that fuses quantum autoencoders with adversarial training to learn compact latent representations of quantum states. We use the model to generate energy profiles of simple molecules.

Next, we shift to the problem of thermal state preparation with Meta-VQT and NN-Meta VQT—two meta-learning variational algorithms that generalize across many-body Hamiltonians. We achieve up to 30× speedups over traditional methods such as VarQITE in few qubit systems simulation.

Finally, we present HELIA, a hardware-efficient ansatz grounded in Lie algebra dynamics, paired with a dual training strategy that combines classical simulation and quantum gradients. This hybrid approach mitigates barren plateaus and reduces quantum resource usage by up to 60%, while maintaining high accuracy in ground-state estimation and phase classification tasks.

These works lay the groundwork towards next milestones of QML that is deployment at scale, is HW tested, and has a potential for quantum advantage.

Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) is a supervised machine learning algorithm that harnesses the input-driven dynamics of a complex quantum system (viz. `reservoir') to solve temporal tasks, by leveraging the system's intrinsic memory of a few past inputs. Compared to conventional neural networks, reservoir computing provides much simpler and faster training. In this talk, following a brief outline of QRC, I will present some intriguing aspects of QRC using a hybrid qubit-boson system governed by the Jaynes–Cummings Hamiltonian and its dispersive limit. This includes an analysis of their memory capacity across parameter regimes, and their performance in predicting chaotic time-series data.

### [Quantum Colloquium] Rajamani Vijayaraghavan—Observing quantum effects in a “macroscopic” electrical circuit (presented online)

**Colloquium on the Nobel Prize in Physics, 2025**

The Nobel Prize in Physics for 2025 has been awarded to John Clarke, Michel Devoret, and John Martinis for conducting a series of experiments that demonstrated quantum tunneling and energy quantization in a “macroscopic” electrical circuit for the first time. In this talk, I will explain the experiments they conducted using a superconducting electrical circuit element called a Josephson junction. I will illustrate how this experiment was a master stroke in both the choice of the system and the clever engineering used to sufficiently isolate it from its environment, enabling the observation of quantum effects.

These early experiments set the stage for the development of quantum bits using superconducting circuits, a leading architecture for building practical quantum computers. Since one of the laureates, Michel Devoret, is also my PhD advisor, I hope to share some anecdotes and my own experience working with him, including an experiment very closely related to the one recognized by this year’s Nobel Prize in Physics.

**About.** Dr. Vijayaraghavan carried out his doctoral research at Yale University with Prof. Michel Devoret, who is one of the recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2025. This was followed by postdoctoral work at the University of California, Berkeley. At both these places he worked on problems related to the measurement of superconducting quantum bits.

He is currently an Associate Professor at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai and heads the Quantum Measurement and Control Laboratory where the research focuses on superconducting quantum circuits. He is currently leading several projects to build small to medium scale quantum processors with funding from DAE, DRDO, TCS and DST. He is also the Lead PI for the Technical Group working on building superconducting quantum computers under the National Quantum Mission. He is a recipient of the Ramanujan Fellowship (2013-18) awarded by the Department of Science and Technology of the Government of India, and a Fellow of the Indian Academy of Sciences, Bangalore since January 2024. He was awarded the Pancharatnam prize for excellence in quantum science and technology by the Government of Karnataka in July 2025.

### [Quantum Seminar] Riddhi Ghosal—[Quantum Advantage via Solving Multivariate Polynomials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07276) (presented online)

<img align="left" width="140" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/14ffdf8a-29fc-4d74-8a07-ac03c059e649" />

In this work, we propose a new way to (non-interactively, verifiably) demonstrate quantum advantage by solving the average-case 𝖭𝖯 search problem of finding a solution to a system of (underdetermined) constant degree multivariate equations over the finite field 𝔽2 drawn from a specified distribution. In particular, for any d≥2, we design a distribution of degree up to d polynomials {pi(x1,…,xn)}i∈[m] for m<n over 𝔽2 for which we show that there is a expected polynomial-time quantum algorithm that provably simultaneously solves {pi(x1,…,xn)=yi}i∈[m] for a random vector (y1,…,ym). On the other hand, while solutions exist with high probability, we conjecture that for constant d>2, it is classically hard to find one based on a thorough review of existing classical cryptanalysis. Our work thus posits that degree three functions are enough to instantiate the random oracle to obtain non-relativized quantum advantage.
Our approach begins with the breakthrough Yamakawa-Zhandry (FOCS 2022) quantum algorithmic framework. In our work, we demonstrate that this quantum algorithmic framework extends to the setting of multivariate polynomial systems.
Our key technical contribution is a new analysis on the Fourier spectra of distributions induced by a general family of distributions over 𝔽2 multivariate polynomials -- those that satisfy 2-wise independence and shift-invariance. This family of distributions includes the distribution of uniform random degree at most d polynomials for any constant d≥2. Our analysis opens up potentially new directions for quantum cryptanalysis of other multivariate systems.

### [Quantum Seminar] Timothée Hoffreumon—Has real quantum theory truly been falsified? (presented online)

Renou et al. (2021) argued that quantum theory based on real Hilbert spaces cannot reproduce all predictions of complex quantum theory, identifying a testable discrepancy via a Bell inequality in the bilocal (entanglement-swapping) scenario. While this result suggested real quantum theory is falsifiable, it has since faced criticism, with several groups questioning its assumptions. In this talk, we first present our critique, then situate it within broader discussions by other groups. Our analysis traces the discrepancy to assuming the Kronecker product as the universal tensor product, despite its bilinearity depending on the chosen number field. We propose two consistent alternatives: 1) relaxing the state postulate, or 2) adopting a non-Kronecker tensor product, both of which recover standard quantum predictions. The latter connects to generalized composition rules in Operational Probabilistic Theories and interpretations in terms of Quantum Reference Frames and time-reversal symmetry. Since Renou et al.’s experiment relies on assuming, rather than certifying, the Kronecker representation of the tensor product, we raise the question: has real quantum theory truly been falsified?

### [Quantum Seminar] Tanuj Khattar—How to efficiently compile the Extended Euclidean Algorithm? (presented online)

The Extended Euclidean Algorithm (EEA) is a fundamental building block in number theory and computer algebra. It is the standard method for computing modular inverses and the Bézout coefficients for a pair of inputs (f,g) such that f⋅u+g⋅v=gcd(f,g). The EEA is a key subroutine for many quantum algorithms, most notably to calculate modular inverses in Shor's algorithm for discrete log and factoring and for decoding Reed Solomon codes in Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI). In this talk, we will talk about how to compile efficient quantum circuits for EEA in two different regimes—one where Implicit access to Bézout coefficients is sufficient and second when explicit access to Bézout coefficients is needed.

I will try to structure the talk such that very little background in Quantum Computing is expected; and would encourage all students who enjoy computer science and competitive programming to attend the seminar.

### [Quantum Seminar] Zhiyan DING—[End-to-End Efficient Quantum Thermal and Ground State Preparation Made Simple](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05703) (presented online)

We propose new quantum algorithms for thermal and ground state preparation based on system-bath interactions. These algorithms require only forward evolution under a system-bath Hamiltonian in which the bath is a single reusable ancilla qubit, making them especially well-suited for early fault-tolerant quantum devices. By carefully designing the bath and interaction Hamiltonians, we prove that the fixed point of the dynamics accurately approximates the desired quantum state. Furthermore, we establish theoretical guarantees on the mixing time for several physically relevant models, thereby providing a rigorous justification for the end-to-end efficiency of system-bath interaction models in thermal and ground state preparation.

Can you infer the capability of a network in distributed teleportation by just counting the path length? Yes you can. You may understand the capability of a  quantum network in distributed teleportation globally by a single metric. We show that the average of the maximum teleportation fidelities between all pairs of nodes in a large quantum repeater network is a measure of the resourcefulness of the network . It can be used for arbitrary topologies, with and without loops. As  examples,  we consider  topologies (the star, the chain, some trees, and also the ring and the complete graph) with links being simple Werner state-based models. We consider three (semi)realistic scenarios for our analysis. In addition to identifying the parameter ranges for quantum advantages that can be achieved by the network, we also show the large-𝑁 behaviors.

The compressed oracle technique, introduced in the context of quantum cryptanalysis, is the latest method for proving quantum query lower bounds, and has had an impressive number of applications since its introduction, due in part to the ease of importing classical lower bound intuition into the quantum setting via this method. Previously, the main quantum query lower bound methods were the polynomial method, the adversary method, and the multiplicative adversary method, and their relative powers were well understood. In this work, we situate the compressed oracle technique within this established landscape, by showing that it is a special case of the multiplicative adversary method. To accomplish this, we introduce a simplified restriction of the multiplicative adversary method, the MLADV method, that remains powerful enough to capture the polynomial method and exhibit a strong direct product theorem, but is much simpler to reason about. We show that the compressed oracle technique is also captured by the MLADV method. This might make the MLADV method a promising direction in the current quest to extend the compressed oracle technique to non-product distributions.

### [Quantum Seminar] Dominik Leichtle—[Bounding the asymptotic quantum value of all multipartite compiled non-local games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12408) (presented online)

<img align="left" width="140" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec1b6262-3b76-4de0-a3c8-763bf8411f3d" />

Non-local games are a powerful tool to distinguish between correlations possible in classical and quantum worlds. Kalai et al. (STOC'23) proposed a compiler that converts multipartite non-local games into interactive protocols with a single prover, relying on cryptographic tools to remove the assumption of physical separation of the players. While quantum completeness and classical soundness of the construction have been established for all multipartite games, quantum soundness is known only in the special case of bipartite games.
In this paper, we prove that the Kalai et al.'s compiler indeed achieves quantum soundness for all multipartite compiled non-local games, by showing that any correlations that can be generated in the asymptotic case correspond to quantum commuting strategies.
Our proof uses techniques from the theory of operator algebras, and relies on a characterisation of sequential operationally no-signalling strategies as quantum commuting operator strategies in the multipartite case, thereby generalising several previous results. On the way, we construct universal C*-algebras of sequential PVMs and prove a new chain rule for Radon-Nikodym derivatives of completely positive maps on C*-algebras which may be of independent interest.

In their seminal work, Gentry and Wichs (STOC'11) established an impossibility result for the task of constructing an adaptively-sound SNARG via black-box reduction from a falsifiable assumption. An exciting set of recent SNARG constructions demonstrated that, if one adopts a weaker but still quite meaningful notion of adaptive soundness, then impossibility no longer holds (Waters-Wu, Waters-Zhandry, Mathialagan-Peters-Vaikunthanathan ePrint'24). These fascinating new results raise an intriguing possibility: is there a way to remove this slight weakening of adaptive soundness, thereby completely circumventing the Gentry-Wichs impossibility? A natural route to closing this gap would be to use a quantum black-box reduction, i.e., a reduction that can query the SNARG adversary on superpositions of inputs. This would take advantage of the fact that Gentry-Wichs only consider classical reductions. In this work, we show that this approach cannot succeed. Specifically, we extend the Gentry-Wichs impossibility result to quantum black-box reductions, and thereby establish an important limit on the power of such reductions.

We study Schrödinger operators in the context of (constrained) convex optimization, and interior point methods more specifically. As our main result, we give non-asymptotic bounds on the spectral gap of these Schrödinger operators. Our analysis combines tools from quantum mechanics (semiclassical analysis) and convex optimization (self-concordant barriers). As an application, we combine these bounds with quantum annealing to design a quantum interior point method.

Entanglement is a fundamental resource in quantum information processing, yet understanding its manipulation and transformation remains a challenge. Many tasks rely on highly entangled pure states, but obtaining such states is often challenging due to the presence of noise. Typically, entanglement manipulation procedures involving asymptotically many copies of a state are considered to overcome this problem. These procedures allow for distilling highly entangled pure states from noisy states, which enables a wide range of applications, such as quantum teleportation and quantum cryptography. When it comes to manipulating entangled quantum systems on a single copy level, using entangled states as catalysts can significantly broaden the range of achievable transformations. Similar to the concept of catalysis in chemistry, the entangled catalyst is returned unchanged at the end of the state manipulation procedure. Our results demonstrate that despite the apparent conceptual differences between the asymptotic and catalytic settings, they are actually strongly connected and fully equivalent for all distillable states. Our methods rely on the analysis of many-copy entanglement manipulation procedures which may establish correlations between different copies. As an important consequence, we demonstrate that using an entangled catalyst cannot enhance the asymptotic singlet distillation rate of a distillable quantum state. Our findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the capabilities and limitations of both catalytic and asymptotic state transformations of entangled states, and highlight the importance of correlations in these processes.

Quantum networks connect systems at separate locations via quantum links, enabling a wide range of quantum information tasks between distant parties. Large-scale networks have the potential to enable global secure communication, distributed quantum computation, enhanced clock synchronization, and high-precision multiparameter metrology. For the optimal development of these technologies, however, it is essential to identify the necessary resources and sub-routines that will lead to the quantum advantage, but this is demanding even for the simplest protocols in quantum information processing. Here we show that in the absence of classical communication, quantum networks relying on the long-distance distribution of bipartite entanglement, combined with local operations and shared randomness, cannot achieve a relevant quantum advantage. Specifically, we prove that these networks do not help in preparing resourceful quantum states such as Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states or cluster states, despite the free availability of long-distance entanglement. At an abstract level, our work points towards a fundamental difference between bipartite and multipartite entanglement. From a practical perspective, our results highlight the need for classical communication combined with quantum memories to fully harness the power of quantum networks.

In this Letter, we develop a panoramic schematic of quantum thermal analogs of electric circuits in the steady state regime. We establish the foundations of said premise by defining the analogs of Kirchhoff’s laws for heat currents and temperature gradients, as well as a quantum thermal step transformer. Using this, we develop two novel quantum thermal circuits, viz., quantum thermal super Wheatstone bridge and quantum thermal adder circuit, paving the way for the corresponding integrated circuits. We further show that our approach encompasses various circuits like thermal diode, transistor, and Wheatstone bridge. This sheds new light on the present architecture of quantum device engineering.

Quantum correlations in the form of entanglement, quantum steering or Bell nonlocality are resources for various information-processing tasks, but their detailed quantification and characterization remains complicated. One counter-intuitive effect is the phenomenon of superactivation, meaning that two copies of a quantum state may exhibit forms of correlations which are absent on the single-copy level. We develop a systematic approach towards a full understanding of this phenomenon using the paradigm of genuine multipartite entanglement. We introduce systematic methods for studying superactivation of entanglement based on symmetries and generalized notions of multipartite distillability. With this, we present novel criteria for superactivation as well as a quantitative theory of it. Moreover, we present evidence for incompressible entanglement on multi-copy systems, which cannot be reduced to the single-copy level.

### Cancelled ~[Quantum Seminar] Gilad Gour—Advances in Single-Shot Quantum Information: The Role of Collision Relative Entropy (online-only)~

<!-- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bef5e1ba-9f7f-4a6d-8033-ed83579192b3) -->

This talk presents two recent advances in single-shot quantum information theory that emphasize the fundamental role of the collision relative entropy in refining our understanding of quantum divergences and strengthening key tools for quantum communication and source coding beyond the i.i.d. regime. The first result is an equality-based reformulation of the convex split lemma, which traditionally involves inequalities with max mutual information; the new version replaces this with a tight equality using the collision mutual information (derived from the sandwiched Rényi relative entropy of order two), yielding stronger achievability results and an additive, dimension-independent upper bound on the smoothed max mutual information. The second development introduces the induced divergence, a smoothed quantum divergence that retains crucial properties like the data processing inequality and interpolates between the parent relative entropy and the min-relative entropy, offering a robust alternative to the hypothesis testing divergence. Applying this to the collision relative entropy produces an improved position-based decoding lemma, enhancing decoding success, broadening applicability, and reducing resource requirements, with significant implications for protocols such as quantum state redistribution and classical communication over quantum channels. Together, these results demonstrate how leveraging the collision relative entropy and its induced counterpart leads to tighter bounds and deeper structural insights into non-asymptotic quantum information processing.

Signaling quantum channels are fundamental to quantum communication, enabling the transfer of information from input to output states. In contrast, thermalisation erases information about the initial state. This raises a crucial question: How does the thermalising tendency of a quantum channel constrain its signaling power and vice versa? In this work, we address this question by considering three thermodynamic tasks associated with a quantum channel: the generation, preservation, and transmission of athermality. We provide faithful measures for athermality generation and athermality preservation of quantum channels, and prove that their difference quantifies athermality transmission. Analysing these thermodynamic tasks, we find that the signaling ability of a quantum channel is upper-bounded by its athermality preservation and lower-bounded by its athermality transmission, thereby establishing a fundamental relationship between signaling and thermodynamic properties of channels for quantum communication. We demonstrate this interplay for the example of the quantum switch, revealing an explicit trade-off between the signaling ability and athermality of the quantum channels it can implement.

In a proof of knowledge (PoK), a verifier becomes convinced that a prover possesses privileged information. In combination with zero-knowledge proof systems, PoKs are an important part of secure protocols such as digital signature schemes and authentication schemes as they enable a prover to demonstrate possession of a certain piece of information (such as a private key or a credential), without revealing it. Formally, A PoK is defined via the existence of an extractor, which is capable of reconstructing the key information that makes a verifier accept, given oracle access to the prover. We extend the concept of a PoK in the setting of a single classical verifier and two quantum provers, and exhibit the PoK property for a non-local game for the local Hamiltonian problem. More specifically, we construct an extractor which, given oracle access to a provers' strategy that leads to high acceptance probability, is able to reconstruct the ground state of a local Hamiltonian. Our result can be seen as a new form of self-testing, where, in addition to certifying a pre-shared entangled state and the prover's strategy, the verifier also certifies a local quantum state. This technique thus provides a method to ascertain that a prover has access to a quantum system, in particular, a ground state, thus indicating a new level of verification for a proof of quantumness.

We show how to construct simulation secure one-time memories, and thus one-time programs, without computational assumptions in the presence of constraints on quantum hardware. Specifically, we build one-time memories from random linear codes and quantum random access codes (QRACs) when constrained to non-adaptive, constant depth, and D-dimensional geometrically-local quantum circuit for some constant D. We place no restrictions on the adversary's classical computational power, number of qubits it can use, or the coherence time of its qubits. Notably, our construction can still be secure even in the presence of fault tolerant quantum computation as long as the input qubits are encoded in a non-fault tolerant manner (e.g. encoded as high energy states in non-ideal hardware). Unfortunately though, our construction requires decoding random linear codes and thus does not run in polynomial time. We leave open the question of whether one can construct a polynomial time information theoretically secure one-time memory from geometrically local quantum circuits.
Of potentially independent interest, we develop a progress bound for information leakage via collision entropy (Renyi entropy of order 2) along with a few key technical lemmas for a "mutual information" for collision entropies. We also develop new bounds on how much information a specific 2↦1 QRAC can leak about its input, which may be of independent interest as well.

This talk will present a study of Kolmogorov complexity for general quantum states from the perspective of deterministic-control quantum Turing Machines (dcq-TM). We introduce the dcq-TM model and define dcq-computable states as those that can be approximated by a dcq-TM. Then, we introduce (conditional) Kolmogorov complexity of quantum states and use it to study three particular aspects of the algorithmic information contained in a quantum state: a comparison of the information in a quantum state with that of its classical representation as an array of real numbers, an exploration of the limits of quantum state copying in the context of algorithmic complexity, and study of the complexity of correlations in quantum systems, resulting in a correlation-aware definition for algorithmic mutual information that satisfies symmetry of information property.

In 2005, Høyer and Špalek showed that constant-depth quantum circuits augmented with multi-qubit Fanout gates are quite powerful, able to compute a wide variety of Boolean functions as well as the quantum Fourier transform. They also asked what other multi-qubit gates could rival Fanout in terms of computational power, and suggested that the quantum Threshold gate might be one such candidate. Threshold is the gate that indicates if the Hamming weight of a classical basis state input is greater than some target value.

We prove that Threshold is indeed powerful—there are polynomial-size constant-depth quantum circuits with Threshold gates that compute Fanout to high fidelity. Our proof is a generalization of a proof by Rosenthal that exponential-size constant-depth circuits with generalized Toffoli gates can compute Fanout. Our construction reveals that other quantum gates able to “weakly approximate” Parity can also be used as substitutes for Fanout.

CSS codes are a class of quantum codes which are constructed based on pairs of dual-containing classical codes. In this talk, we will review CSS codes briefly. Then, we will discuss hypergraph product codes whose rate grows linearly and distance grows as square root of the block length. We will move on to a construction of QLDPC codes known as lifted product codes, whose rate grows as log(N) and distance grows as N/log(N). Finally, we will cover some details about quantum Tanner codes which are extensions of lifted product codes. Quantum Tanner codes themselves have linear rate and distance.

Tree tensor network states (TTNS) form a class of physically motivated quantum states. We study the task of testing TTNS in the property testing framework, wherein one is handed multiple copies of an unknown quantum state, and performs measurements to determine whether the state forms a TTNS (of a given bond dimension) or is epsilon-far from TTNS. The minimum number of copies required is called the copy complexity of the task. We prove nearly tight bounds on the copy complexity of testing TTNS. This generalizes prior works on testing matrix product states (MPS), and closes a gap left in these works. No prior knowledge of quantum computing will be assumed. Based on joint work with Angus Lowe.

### [Quantum Seminar] Rohit Chatterjee—[The Round Complexity of Black-Box Post-Quantum Secure Computation](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/494.pdf)

<!-- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b002bab7-0038-43b4-b5f5-5098a93b1920) -->


<img align="left" width="140" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b002bab7-0038-43b4-b5f5-5098a93b1920" />

We study the round complexity of secure multi-party computation (MPC) in the post-quantum regime. Our focus is on the fully black-box setting, where both the construction and security reduction are black-box. Chia, Chung, Liu, and Yamakawa [FOCS'22] demonstrated the infeasibility of achieving standard simulation-based security within constant rounds unless NP⊆BQP. This leaves crucial feasibility questions unresolved. Specifically, it remains unknown whether black-box constructions are achievable within polynomial rounds; also, the existence of constant-round constructions with respect to ϵ-simulation, a relaxed yet useful alternative to standard simulation, remains unestablished.
This work provides positive answers. We introduce the first black-box construction for PQ-MPC in polynomial rounds, from the minimal assumption of post-quantum semi-honest oblivious transfers. In the two-party scenario, our construction requires only ω(1) rounds. These results have already been applied in the oracle separation between classical-communication quantum MPC and P=NP in Kretschmer, Qian, and Tal [STOC'25].
As for ϵ-simulation, Chia, Chung, Liang, and Yamakawa [CRYPTO'22] resolved the issue for the two-party setting, leaving the multi-party case open. We complete the picture by presenting the first black-box, constant-round construction in the multi-party setting, instantiable using various standard post-quantum primitives.
En route, we obtain a black-box, constant-round post-quantum commitment achieving a weaker version of 1-many non-malleability, from post-quantum one-way functions. Besides its role in our MPC construction, this commitment also reduces the assumption used in the quantum parallel repetition lower bound by Bostanci, Qian, Spooner, and Yuen [STOC'24]. We anticipate further applications in the future.

We analyze bipartite matrices and linear maps between matrix algebras, which are respectively, invariant and covariant, under the diagonal unitary and orthogonal groups' actions. By presenting an expansive list of examples from the literature, which includes notable entries like the Diagonal Symmetric states and the Choi-type maps, we show that this class of matrices (and maps) encompasses a wide variety of scenarios, thereby unifying their study. We examine their linear algebraic structure and investigate different notions of positivity through their convex conic manifestations. In particular, we generalize the well-known cone of completely positive matrices to that of triplewise completely positive matrices and connect it to the separability of the relevant invariant states (or the entanglement breaking property of the corresponding quantum channels). For linear maps, we provide explicit characterizations of the stated covariance in terms of their Kraus, Stinespring, and Choi representations, and systematically analyze the usual properties of positivity, decomposability, complete positivity, and the like. We also describe the invariant subspaces of these maps and use their structure to provide necessary and sufficient conditions for separability of the associated invariant bipartite states.

### [Quantum Seminar] Barak Nehoran—[Unconditionally Secure Commitments with Quantum Auxiliary Inputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18566)

<img align="left" width="140" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc5bd4a2-817f-4df8-8758-0aac58a8b7b6" />


We show the following unconditional results on quantum commitments in two related yet different models:

(1) We revisit the notion of quantum auxiliary-input commitments introduced by Chailloux, Kerenidis, and Rosgen (Comput. Complex. 2016) where both the committer and receiver take the same quantum state, which is determined by the security parameter, as quantum auxiliary inputs. We show that computationally-hiding and statistically-binding quantum auxiliary-input commitments exist unconditionally, i.e., without relying on any unproven assumption, while Chailloux et al. assumed a complexity-theoretic assumption, QIP⊈QMA. On the other hand, we observe that achieving both statistical hiding and statistical binding at the same time is impossible even in the quantum auxiliary-input setting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of unconditionally proving computational security of any form of (classical or quantum) commitments for which statistical security is impossible. As intermediate steps toward our construction, we introduce and unconditionally construct post-quantum sparse pseudorandom distributions and quantum auxiliary-input EFI pairs which may be of independent interest.

(2) We introduce a new model which we call the common reference quantum state (CRQS) model where both the committer and receiver take the same quantum state that is randomly sampled by an efficient setup algorithm. We unconditionally prove that there exist statistically hiding and statistically binding commitments in the CRQS model, circumventing the impossibility in the plain model.
We also discuss their applications to zero-knowledge proofs, oblivious transfers, and multi-party computations.

### [Quantum Seminar] Mark M. Wilde—[Quantum thermodynamics and semi-definite optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04514)

<img align="left" width="140" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3cb99c12-a7f5-4ec8-a34d-5f033661d00a" />


In quantum thermodynamics, a system is described by a Hamiltonian and a list of non-commuting charges representing conserved quantities like particle number or electric charge, and an important goal is to determine the system’s minimum energy in the presence of these conserved charges. In optimization theory, a semi-definite program involves a linear objective function optimized over the cone of positive semi-definite operators intersected with an affine space. These problems arise from differing motivations in the physics and optimization communities and are phrased using very different terminology, yet they are essentially identical mathematically. By adopting Jaynes’ mindset motivated by quantum thermodynamics, I’ll discuss how minimizing free energy in the aforementioned thermodynamics problem, instead of energy, leads to an elegant solution in terms of a dual chemical potential maximization problem that is concave in the chemical potential parameters. As such, one can employ standard (stochastic) gradient ascent methods to find the optimal values of these parameters, and these methods are guaranteed to converge quickly. At low temperature, the minimum free energy provides an excellent approximation for the minimum energy. I’ll then show how this Jaynes-inspired gradient-ascent approach can be used in both classical and quantum algorithms for minimizing energy, and equivalently, how it can be used for solving semi-definite programs, with guarantees on the runtimes of the algorithms. The approach discussed here is well grounded in quantum thermodynamics and, as such, provides physical motivation underpinning why algorithms published fifty years after Jaynes’ seminal work, including the matrix multiplicative weights update method, the matrix exponentiated gradient update method, and their quantum algorithmic generalizations, perform well at semi-definite optimization tasks. Joint work with Nana Liu, Michele Minervini, and Dhrumil Patel.

Quantum states act as resources in many quantum information tasks, in particular entangled states for quantum networks allow for security, communication complexity and distributed sensing not possible classically.
In order to exploit this advantage, it is important to be sure the state that is the one that is expected - this is the problem of certification. We present some general techniques for verification and certification of quantum states for networks and their applications.

Yes, we show that they are.
We initiate the study of languages that necessarily need uncloneable quantum proofs and advice. We define strictly uncloneable versions of the classes QMA, BQP/qpoly and FEQP/qpoly (which is the class of relational problems solvable exactly with polynomial-sized quantum advice). Strictly uncloneable QMA is defined to be the class of languages in QMA that only have uncloneable proofs, i.e., given any family of candidate proof states, a polynomial-time cloning algorithm cannot act on it to produce states that are jointly usable by k separate polynomial-time verifiers, for arbitrary polynomial k. This is a stronger notion of uncloneable proofs and advice than those considered in previous works, which only required the existence of a single family of proof or advice states that are uncloneable. We show that in the quantum oracle model, there exist languages in strictly uncloneable QMA and strictly uncloneable BQP/qpoly. The language in strictly uncloneable QMA also gives a quantum oracle separation between QMA and the class cloneableQMA introduced by Nehoran and Zhandry (2024). We also show without using any oracles that the language, used by Aaronson, Buhrman and Kretschmer (2024) to separate FEQP/qpoly and FBQP/poly, is in strictly uncloneable FEQP/qpoly.

We develop new algorithms for Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT), a unifying framework underlying a wide range of quantum algorithms. Existing implementations of QSVT rely on block encoding, incurring O(logL) ancilla overhead and circuit depth O˜(dλL) for polynomial transformations of a Hamiltonian H=∑Lk=1λkHk, where d is polynomial degree, and λ=∑k|λk|. We introduce a new approach that eliminates block encoding, needs only a single ancilla qubit, and maintains near-optimal complexity, using only basic Hamiltonian simulation methods such as Trotterization. Our method achieves a circuit depth of O˜(L(dλcomm)1+o(1)), without any multi-qubit controlled gates. Here, λcomm depends on the nested commutators of the Hk's and can be much smaller than λ. Central to our technique is a novel use of Richardson extrapolation, enabling systematic error cancellation in interleaved sequences of arbitrary unitaries and Hamiltonian evolution operators, establishing a broadly applicable framework beyond QSVT. Additionally, we propose two randomized QSVT algorithms for cases with only sampling access to Hamiltonian terms. The first uses qDRIFT, while the second replaces block encodings in QSVT with randomly sampled unitaries. Both achieve quadratic complexity in d, which we establish as a lower bound for any randomized method implementing polynomial transformations in this model. Finally, as applications, we develop end-to-end quantum algorithms for quantum linear systems and ground state property estimation, achieving near-optimal complexity without oracular access. Our results provide a new framework for quantum algorithms, reducing hardware overhead while maintaining near-optimal performance, with implications for both near-term and fault-tolerant quantum computing.

<!-- <img align="left" width="140" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db048bbd-b64f-4065-8cde-0029af4d164e" /> -->

We introduce the pseudorandom quantum authentication scheme (PQAS), an efficient method for encrypting quantum states that relies solely on the existence of pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs). The scheme guarantees that for any eavesdropper with quantum polynomial-time (QPT) computational power, the encrypted states are indistinguishable from the maximally mixed state. Furthermore, the receiver can verify that the state has not been tampered with and recover the original state with asymptotically unit fidelity. Our scheme is cost-effective, requiring only polylogarithmic circuit depth and a single shared key to encrypt a polynomial number of states. Notably, the PQAS can potentially exist even without quantum-secure one-way functions, requiring fundamentally weaker computational assumptions than semantic classical cryptography. Additionally, PQAS is secure against attacks that plague protocols based on QPT indistinguishability from Haar random states, such as chosen-plaintext attacks (CPAs) and attacks that reveal meta-information such as quantum resources. We relate the amount of meta-information that is leaked to quantum pseudoresources, giving the concept a practical meaning. As an application, we construct important cryptographic primitives, such as verifiable pseudorandom density matrices (VPRDMs), which are QPT-indistinguishable from random mixed states while being efficiently verifiable via a secret key, as well as verifiable noise-robust EFI pairs and one-way state generators (OWSGs). Our results establish a new paradigm of quantum information processing with weaker computational assumptions.

### [Quantum Talk] Aryaman Kolhe—A Study of Bias-Preserving Gates
In realistic quantum hardware, the noise channel could be more biased towards either X or Z errors, so it is possible to construct fault-tolerant schemes that focus on handling this biased noise. However, the application of certain gates during computation can change this noise bias, which leads to the study of bias-preserving gates, whose properties will be discussed in this talk.

### [Quantum Seminar] Ulysse Chabaud—[Can effective descriptions of bosonic systems be considered complete?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13857)

<img align="left" width="140" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21fd3bb4-c6a0-4d1c-9093-9a81e8e78e7d" />

Bosonic statistics give rise to remarkable phenomena, from the Hong–Ou–Mandel effect to Bose–Einstein condensation, with applications spanning fundamental science to quantum technologies. Modeling bosonic systems relies heavily on effective descriptions: typical examples include truncating their infinite-dimensional state space and restricting their dynamics to a simple class of Hamiltonians, such as polynomials of canonical operators, which are used to define quantum computing over bosonic modes. However, many natural bosonic Hamiltonians do not belong to this simple class, and some quantum effects harnessed by bosonic computers inherently require infinite dimensional spaces, questioning the validity of such effective descriptions of bosonic systems. How can we trust results obtained with such simplifying assumptions to capture real effects? 
Driven by the increasing importance of bosonic systems for quantum technologies, we solve this outstanding problem by showing that these effective descriptions do in fact capture the relevant physics of bosonic systems. Our technical contribution is twofold: firstly, we prove that any physical, bosonic unitary evolution can be strongly approximated by a finite-dimensional unitary evolution; secondly, we show that any finite-dimensional unitary evolution can be generated exactly by a bosonic Hamiltonian that is a polynomial of canonical operators. Beyond their fundamental significance, our results have implications for classical and quantum simulations of bosonic systems, they provide universal methods for engineering bosonic quantum states and Hamiltonians, they show that polynomial Hamiltonians do generate universal gate sets for quantum computing over bosonic modes, and they lead to an infinite-dimensional Solovay–Kitaev theorem.

### [Quantum Seminar] Ravi Kunjwal—[What's nonclassical about indefinite causal order?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02565)

Causal inequalities are device-independent constraints on correlations realizable via local operations under the assumption of definite causal order between these operations. While causal inequalities in the bipartite scenario require nonclassical resources within the process-matrix framework for their violation, there exist tripartite causal inequalities that admit violations with classical resources. The tripartite case puts into question the status of a causal inequality violation as a witness of nonclassicality, i.e., there is no a priori reason to believe that quantum effects are in general necessary for a causal inequality violation. Here we propose antinomicity as a notion of nonclassicality for correlations in the presence of indefinite causality and prove strict inclusions between correlation sets classified by their antinomicity. This article provides a causal perspective on antinomicity, complementing the device-independent perspective adopted in arXiv:2411.11397. Besides providing important background to the results reported in arXiv:2411.11397, including proofs of key technical results, we also define a weight-based measure for the antinomicity of correlations that we term the antinomy weight of a correlation. We then investigate antinomic correlations in bipartite and tripartite scenarios with binary settings and outcomes. In doing so, we discover antinomic correlations that are impossible in the process-matrix framework.

While separable states are essentially alike, multipartite entangled states exhibit a rich diversity of structures. One notable form of such entanglement is m-uniformity, whose extremal case—absolutely maximally entangled (AME) states—has been studied across various domains, including quantum cryptography, quantum error correction, and holography.

In this talk, we explore how n-qubit, m-uniform states correspond to [[n,0,m+1]]-distance quantum codes. We then introduce a method for "teleporting" information into a set of quantum registers. By combining these ideas, we construct [[n,k,m+1]] quantum codes and derive bounds relating the parameters n, k, and m. <sup>[[1]](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.108.022426),[[2]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10591769),[[3]](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VQ89UiaoFFwSp0seL_CuttrqH67_3KJP?usp=sharing)</sup>

### [Quantum Visitor/Informal Talk] Venkata Koppula—Verification and Delegation of (Quantum) Computation

<img align="left" width="140" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31cde43a-b4aa-4233-9885-a8c587fd1adf" />

Abstract: Consider a resource-bounded client that wants to outsource some computation C to a powerful server. The client might want the following desirable features: 

(a) Verifiability - some proof that the server has indeed performed the computation C <br/>
(b) Blind Delegation - the server performs the computation without learning anything about C

I will briefly discuss how these properties can achieved in the classical setting (where both client and server are classical, but the server is more powerful than the client). Next, I will discuss some recent progress for these questions in the quantum setting, where the server is quantum, and the client is classical. Both these problems can be solved using a single cryptographic tool. No crypto background will be assumed for this talk.

  ### Achim Kempf—Encrypted Qubits can be Cloned 
We show that encrypted cloning of unknown quantum states is possible. Any number of encrypted clones of a qubit can be created through a unitary transformation, and each of the encrypted clones can be decrypted through a unitary transformation. The decryption of an encrypted clone consumes the decryption key, i.e., only one decryption is possible, in agreement with the no-cloning theorem. A possible application of encrypted cloning is to enable encrypted quantum multi-cloud storage. Beyond applications in cryptography, encrypted cloning could provide a form of redundancy, parallelism, fault tolerance or scalability where direct duplication is forbidden by the no-cloning theorem.

### [Quantum Seminar] Nicolai Friis—[Activation of Genuine Multipartite Entanglement: state-space structures beyond the single-copy paradigm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18331)

Quantum correlations in the form of entanglement, quantum steering or Bell nonlocality are resources for various information-processing tasks, but their detailed quantification and characterization remains complicated. One counter-intuitive effect is the phenomenon of superactivation, meaning that two copies of a quantum state may exhibit forms of correlations which are absent on the single-copy level. We develop a systematic approach towards a full understanding of this phenomenon using the paradigm of genuine multipartite entanglement. We introduce systematic methods for studying superactivation of entanglement based on symmetries and generalized notions of multipartite distillability. With this, we present novel criteria for superactivation as well as a quantitative theory of it. Moreover, we present evidence for incompressible entanglement on multi-copy systems, which cannot be reduced to the single-copy level.

In this Letter, we develop a panoramic schematic of quantum thermal analogs of electric circuits in the steady state regime. We establish the foundations of said premise by defining the analogs of Kirchhoff’s laws for heat currents and temperature gradients, as well as a quantum thermal step transformer. Using this, we develop two novel quantum thermal circuits, viz., quantum thermal super Wheatstone bridge and quantum thermal adder circuit, paving the way for the corresponding integrated circuits. We further show that our approach encompasses various circuits like thermal diode, transistor, and Wheatstone bridge. This sheds new light on the present architecture of quantum device engineering.

Quantum networks connect systems at separate locations via quantum links, enabling a wide range of quantum information tasks between distant parties. Large-scale networks have the potential to enable global secure communication, distributed quantum computation, enhanced clock synchronization, and high-precision multiparameter metrology. For the optimal development of these technologies, however, it is essential to identify the necessary resources and sub-routines that will lead to the quantum advantage, but this is demanding even for the simplest protocols in quantum information processing. Here we show that in the absence of classical communication, quantum networks relying on the long-distance distribution of bipartite entanglement, combined with local operations and shared randomness, cannot achieve a relevant quantum advantage. Specifically, we prove that these networks do not help in preparing resourceful quantum states such as Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states or cluster states, despite the free availability of long-distance entanglement. At an abstract level, our work points towards a fundamental difference between bipartite and multipartite entanglement. From a practical perspective, our results highlight the need for classical communication combined with quantum memories to fully harness the power of quantum networks.

### [Quantum Seminar] Tulja Varun Kondra—Catalytic and Asymptotic Equivalence for Quantum Entanglement (visitor, in-person)

<img align="left" width="140" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f276411-901f-4b4e-8b78-1e7a80255720" />

Entanglement is a fundamental resource in quantum information processing, yet understanding its manipulation and transformation remains a challenge. Many tasks rely on highly entangled pure states, but obtaining such states is often challenging due to the presence of noise. Typically, entanglement manipulation procedures involving asymptotically many copies of a state are considered to overcome this problem. These procedures allow for distilling highly entangled pure states from noisy states, which enables a wide range of applications, such as quantum teleportation and quantum cryptography. When it comes to manipulating entangled quantum systems on a single copy level, using entangled states as catalysts can significantly broaden the range of achievable transformations. Similar to the concept of catalysis in chemistry, the entangled catalyst is returned unchanged at the end of the state manipulation procedure. Our results demonstrate that despite the apparent conceptual differences between the asymptotic and catalytic settings, they are actually strongly connected and fully equivalent for all distillable states. Our methods rely on the analysis of many-copy entanglement manipulation procedures which may establish correlations between different copies. As an important consequence, we demonstrate that using an entangled catalyst cannot enhance the asymptotic singlet distillation rate of a distillable quantum state. Our findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the capabilities and limitations of both catalytic and asymptotic state transformations of entangled states, and highlight the importance of correlations in these processes.

### Cancelled ~[Quantum Seminar] Gilad Gour—Advances in Single-Shot Quantum Information: The Role of Collision Relative Entropy (online-only)~

<img align="left" width="140" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bef5e1ba-9f7f-4a6d-8033-ed83579192b3" />

<!-- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bef5e1ba-9f7f-4a6d-8033-ed83579192b3) -->

This talk presents two recent advances in single-shot quantum information theory that emphasize the fundamental role of the collision relative entropy in refining our understanding of quantum divergences and strengthening key tools for quantum communication and source coding beyond the i.i.d. regime. The first result is an equality-based reformulation of the convex split lemma, which traditionally involves inequalities with max mutual information; the new version replaces this with a tight equality using the collision mutual information (derived from the sandwiched Rényi relative entropy of order two), yielding stronger achievability results and an additive, dimension-independent upper bound on the smoothed max mutual information. The second development introduces the induced divergence, a smoothed quantum divergence that retains crucial properties like the data processing inequality and interpolates between the parent relative entropy and the min-relative entropy, offering a robust alternative to the hypothesis testing divergence. Applying this to the collision relative entropy produces an improved position-based decoding lemma, enhancing decoding success, broadening applicability, and reducing resource requirements, with significant implications for protocols such as quantum state redistribution and classical communication over quantum channels. Together, these results demonstrate how leveraging the collision relative entropy and its induced counterpart leads to tighter bounds and deeper structural insights into non-asymptotic quantum information processing.

### [Quantum Seminar] Yutong Luo—[Thermodynamic criteria for signaling in quantum channels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20428)



<img align="left" width="140" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/174b329a-bc99-4f3b-8d25-576167031fac" />

Signaling quantum channels are fundamental to quantum communication, enabling the transfer of information from input to output states. In contrast, thermalisation erases information about the initial state. This raises a crucial question: How does the thermalising tendency of a quantum channel constrain its signaling power and vice versa? In this work, we address this question by considering three thermodynamic tasks associated with a quantum channel: the generation, preservation, and transmission of athermality. We provide faithful measures for athermality generation and athermality preservation of quantum channels, and prove that their difference quantifies athermality transmission. Analysing these thermodynamic tasks, we find that the signaling ability of a quantum channel is upper-bounded by its athermality preservation and lower-bounded by its athermality transmission, thereby establishing a fundamental relationship between signaling and thermodynamic properties of channels for quantum communication. We demonstrate this interplay for the example of the quantum switch, revealing an explicit trade-off between the signaling ability and athermality of the quantum channels it can implement.

### [Quantum Seminar] Nagisa Hara—[A classical proof of quantum knowledge for multi-prover interactive proof systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13699)



<img align="left" width="140" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70774111-fcb2-4332-8b38-0527d9a4066c" />

In a proof of knowledge (PoK), a verifier becomes convinced that a prover possesses privileged information. In combination with zero-knowledge proof systems, PoKs are an important part of secure protocols such as digital signature schemes and authentication schemes as they enable a prover to demonstrate possession of a certain piece of information (such as a private key or a credential), without revealing it. Formally, A PoK is defined via the existence of an extractor, which is capable of reconstructing the key information that makes a verifier accept, given oracle access to the prover. We extend the concept of a PoK in the setting of a single classical verifier and two quantum provers, and exhibit the PoK property for a non-local game for the local Hamiltonian problem. More specifically, we construct an extractor which, given oracle access to a provers' strategy that leads to high acceptance probability, is able to reconstruct the ground state of a local Hamiltonian. Our result can be seen as a new form of self-testing, where, in addition to certifying a pre-shared entangled state and the prover's strategy, the verifier also certifies a local quantum state. This technique thus provides a method to ascertain that a prover has access to a quantum system, in particular, a ground state, thus indicating a new level of verification for a proof of quantumness.

### [Quantum Seminar] Lev Stambler—[Information Theoretic One-Time Programs from Geometrically Local QNC0 Adversaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22016) (online-only)

<img align="left" width="140" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4384e223-a6ec-425b-8e5f-70e5dc2ac373" /> 

<!-- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4384e223-a6ec-425b-8e5f-70e5dc2ac373) -->


We show how to construct simulation secure one-time memories, and thus one-time programs, without computational assumptions in the presence of constraints on quantum hardware. Specifically, we build one-time memories from random linear codes and quantum random access codes (QRACs) when constrained to non-adaptive, constant depth, and D-dimensional geometrically-local quantum circuit for some constant D. We place no restrictions on the adversary's classical computational power, number of qubits it can use, or the coherence time of its qubits. Notably, our construction can still be secure even in the presence of fault tolerant quantum computation as long as the input qubits are encoded in a non-fault tolerant manner (e.g. encoded as high energy states in non-ideal hardware). Unfortunately though, our construction requires decoding random linear codes and thus does not run in polynomial time. We leave open the question of whether one can construct a polynomial time information theoretically secure one-time memory from geometrically local quantum circuits.
Of potentially independent interest, we develop a progress bound for information leakage via collision entropy (Renyi entropy of order 2) along with a few key technical lemmas for a "mutual information" for collision entropies. We also develop new bounds on how much information a specific 2↦1 QRAC can leak about its input, which may be of independent interest as well.

This talk will present a study of Kolmogorov complexity for general quantum states from the perspective of deterministic-control quantum Turing Machines (dcq-TM). We introduce the dcq-TM model and define dcq-computable states as those that can be approximated by a dcq-TM. Then, we introduce (conditional) Kolmogorov complexity of quantum states and use it to study three particular aspects of the algorithmic information contained in a quantum state: a comparison of the information in a quantum state with that of its classical representation as an array of real numbers, an exploration of the limits of quantum state copying in the context of algorithmic complexity, and study of the complexity of correlations in quantum systems, resulting in a correlation-aware definition for algorithmic mutual information that satisfies symmetry of information property.

### [Quantum Seminar] Jackson Morris—[Quantum Threshold is Powerful](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04953)

In 2005, Høyer and Špalek showed that constant-depth quantum circuits augmented with multi-qubit Fanout gates are quite powerful, able to compute a wide variety of Boolean functions as well as the quantum Fourier transform. They also asked what other multi-qubit gates could rival Fanout in terms of computational power, and suggested that the quantum Threshold gate might be one such candidate. Threshold is the gate that indicates if the Hamming weight of a classical basis state input is greater than some target value.

We prove that Threshold is indeed powerful—there are polynomial-size constant-depth quantum circuits with Threshold gates that compute Fanout to high fidelity. Our proof is a generalization of a proof by Rosenthal that exponential-size constant-depth circuits with generalized Toffoli gates can compute Fanout. Our construction reveals that other quantum gates able to “weakly approximate” Parity can also be used as substitutes for Fanout.

CSS codes are a class of quantum codes which are constructed based on pairs of dual-containing classical codes. In this talk, we will review CSS codes briefly. Then, we will discuss hypergraph product codes whose rate grows linearly and distance grows as square root of the block length. We will move on to a construction of QLDPC codes known as lifted product codes, whose rate grows as log(N) and distance grows as N/log(N). Finally, we will cover some details about quantum Tanner codes which are extensions of lifted product codes. Quantum Tanner codes themselves have linear rate and distance.

Tree tensor network states (TTNS) form a class of physically motivated quantum states. We study the task of testing TTNS in the property testing framework, wherein one is handed multiple copies of an unknown quantum state, and performs measurements to determine whether the state forms a TTNS (of a given bond dimension) or is epsilon-far from TTNS. The minimum number of copies required is called the copy complexity of the task. We prove nearly tight bounds on the copy complexity of testing TTNS. This generalizes prior works on testing matrix product states (MPS), and closes a gap left in these works. No prior knowledge of quantum computing will be assumed. Based on joint work with Angus Lowe.

### [Quantum Seminar] Rohit Chatterjee—[The Round Complexity of Black-Box Post-Quantum Secure Computation](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/494.pdf)

<!-- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b002bab7-0038-43b4-b5f5-5098a93b1920) -->


<img align="left" width="140" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b002bab7-0038-43b4-b5f5-5098a93b1920" />

We study the round complexity of secure multi-party computation (MPC) in the post-quantum regime. Our focus is on the fully black-box setting, where both the construction and security reduction are black-box. Chia, Chung, Liu, and Yamakawa [FOCS'22] demonstrated the infeasibility of achieving standard simulation-based security within constant rounds unless NP⊆BQP. This leaves crucial feasibility questions unresolved. Specifically, it remains unknown whether black-box constructions are achievable within polynomial rounds; also, the existence of constant-round constructions with respect to ϵ-simulation, a relaxed yet useful alternative to standard simulation, remains unestablished.
This work provides positive answers. We introduce the first black-box construction for PQ-MPC in polynomial rounds, from the minimal assumption of post-quantum semi-honest oblivious transfers. In the two-party scenario, our construction requires only ω(1) rounds. These results have already been applied in the oracle separation between classical-communication quantum MPC and P=NP in Kretschmer, Qian, and Tal [STOC'25].
As for ϵ-simulation, Chia, Chung, Liang, and Yamakawa [CRYPTO'22] resolved the issue for the two-party setting, leaving the multi-party case open. We complete the picture by presenting the first black-box, constant-round construction in the multi-party setting, instantiable using various standard post-quantum primitives.
En route, we obtain a black-box, constant-round post-quantum commitment achieving a weaker version of 1-many non-malleability, from post-quantum one-way functions. Besides its role in our MPC construction, this commitment also reduces the assumption used in the quantum parallel repetition lower bound by Bostanci, Qian, Spooner, and Yuen [STOC'24]. We anticipate further applications in the future.

### [Quantum Seminar] Ion Nechita—[Diagonal unitary and orthogonal symmetries in quantum theory](https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2021-08-09-519/)

<!-- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0f1da84-8576-4b67-aee5-5488c01ccd1c) -->


We analyze bipartite matrices and linear maps between matrix algebras, which are respectively, invariant and covariant, under the diagonal unitary and orthogonal groups' actions. By presenting an expansive list of examples from the literature, which includes notable entries like the Diagonal Symmetric states and the Choi-type maps, we show that this class of matrices (and maps) encompasses a wide variety of scenarios, thereby unifying their study. We examine their linear algebraic structure and investigate different notions of positivity through their convex conic manifestations. In particular, we generalize the well-known cone of completely positive matrices to that of triplewise completely positive matrices and connect it to the separability of the relevant invariant states (or the entanglement breaking property of the corresponding quantum channels). For linear maps, we provide explicit characterizations of the stated covariance in terms of their Kraus, Stinespring, and Choi representations, and systematically analyze the usual properties of positivity, decomposability, complete positivity, and the like. We also describe the invariant subspaces of these maps and use their structure to provide necessary and sufficient conditions for separability of the associated invariant bipartite states.

### [Quantum Seminar] Barak Nehoran—[Unconditionally Secure Commitments with Quantum Auxiliary Inputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18566)

<img align="left" width="140" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc5bd4a2-817f-4df8-8758-0aac58a8b7b6" />


We show the following unconditional results on quantum commitments in two related yet different models:

(1) We revisit the notion of quantum auxiliary-input commitments introduced by Chailloux, Kerenidis, and Rosgen (Comput. Complex. 2016) where both the committer and receiver take the same quantum state, which is determined by the security parameter, as quantum auxiliary inputs. We show that computationally-hiding and statistically-binding quantum auxiliary-input commitments exist unconditionally, i.e., without relying on any unproven assumption, while Chailloux et al. assumed a complexity-theoretic assumption, QIP⊈QMA. On the other hand, we observe that achieving both statistical hiding and statistical binding at the same time is impossible even in the quantum auxiliary-input setting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of unconditionally proving computational security of any form of (classical or quantum) commitments for which statistical security is impossible. As intermediate steps toward our construction, we introduce and unconditionally construct post-quantum sparse pseudorandom distributions and quantum auxiliary-input EFI pairs which may be of independent interest.

(2) We introduce a new model which we call the common reference quantum state (CRQS) model where both the committer and receiver take the same quantum state that is randomly sampled by an efficient setup algorithm. We unconditionally prove that there exist statistically hiding and statistically binding commitments in the CRQS model, circumventing the impossibility in the plain model.
We also discuss their applications to zero-knowledge proofs, oblivious transfers, and multi-party computations.

### [Quantum Seminar] Mark M. Wilde—[Quantum thermodynamics and semi-definite optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04514)

<img align="left" width="140" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3cb99c12-a7f5-4ec8-a34d-5f033661d00a" />


In quantum thermodynamics, a system is described by a Hamiltonian and a list of non-commuting charges representing conserved quantities like particle number or electric charge, and an important goal is to determine the system’s minimum energy in the presence of these conserved charges. In optimization theory, a semi-definite program involves a linear objective function optimized over the cone of positive semi-definite operators intersected with an affine space. These problems arise from differing motivations in the physics and optimization communities and are phrased using very different terminology, yet they are essentially identical mathematically. By adopting Jaynes’ mindset motivated by quantum thermodynamics, I’ll discuss how minimizing free energy in the aforementioned thermodynamics problem, instead of energy, leads to an elegant solution in terms of a dual chemical potential maximization problem that is concave in the chemical potential parameters. As such, one can employ standard (stochastic) gradient ascent methods to find the optimal values of these parameters, and these methods are guaranteed to converge quickly. At low temperature, the minimum free energy provides an excellent approximation for the minimum energy. I’ll then show how this Jaynes-inspired gradient-ascent approach can be used in both classical and quantum algorithms for minimizing energy, and equivalently, how it can be used for solving semi-definite programs, with guarantees on the runtimes of the algorithms. The approach discussed here is well grounded in quantum thermodynamics and, as such, provides physical motivation underpinning why algorithms published fifty years after Jaynes’ seminal work, including the matrix multiplicative weights update method, the matrix exponentiated gradient update method, and their quantum algorithmic generalizations, perform well at semi-definite optimization tasks. Joint work with Nana Liu, Michele Minervini, and Dhrumil Patel.

Quantum states act as resources in many quantum information tasks, in particular entangled states for quantum networks allow for security, communication complexity and distributed sensing not possible classically.
In order to exploit this advantage, it is important to be sure the state that is the one that is expected - this is the problem of certification. We present some general techniques for verification and certification of quantum states for networks and their applications.

### [Quantum Seminar] Srijita Kundu—[Are uncloneable proof and advice states strictly necessary?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11827)

<img align="left" width="140" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d97e5300-cab8-444f-be78-fad1a346b3ba" />

Yes, we show that they are.
We initiate the study of languages that necessarily need uncloneable quantum proofs and advice. We define strictly uncloneable versions of the classes QMA, BQP/qpoly and FEQP/qpoly (which is the class of relational problems solvable exactly with polynomial-sized quantum advice). Strictly uncloneable QMA is defined to be the class of languages in QMA that only have uncloneable proofs, i.e., given any family of candidate proof states, a polynomial-time cloning algorithm cannot act on it to produce states that are jointly usable by k separate polynomial-time verifiers, for arbitrary polynomial k. This is a stronger notion of uncloneable proofs and advice than those considered in previous works, which only required the existence of a single family of proof or advice states that are uncloneable. We show that in the quantum oracle model, there exist languages in strictly uncloneable QMA and strictly uncloneable BQP/qpoly. The language in strictly uncloneable QMA also gives a quantum oracle separation between QMA and the class cloneableQMA introduced by Nehoran and Zhandry (2024). We also show without using any oracles that the language, used by Aaronson, Buhrman and Kretschmer (2024) to separate FEQP/qpoly and FBQP/poly, is in strictly uncloneable FEQP/qpoly.

We develop new algorithms for Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT), a unifying framework underlying a wide range of quantum algorithms. Existing implementations of QSVT rely on block encoding, incurring O(logL) ancilla overhead and circuit depth O˜(dλL) for polynomial transformations of a Hamiltonian H=∑Lk=1λkHk, where d is polynomial degree, and λ=∑k|λk|. We introduce a new approach that eliminates block encoding, needs only a single ancilla qubit, and maintains near-optimal complexity, using only basic Hamiltonian simulation methods such as Trotterization. Our method achieves a circuit depth of O˜(L(dλcomm)1+o(1)), without any multi-qubit controlled gates. Here, λcomm depends on the nested commutators of the Hk's and can be much smaller than λ. Central to our technique is a novel use of Richardson extrapolation, enabling systematic error cancellation in interleaved sequences of arbitrary unitaries and Hamiltonian evolution operators, establishing a broadly applicable framework beyond QSVT. Additionally, we propose two randomized QSVT algorithms for cases with only sampling access to Hamiltonian terms. The first uses qDRIFT, while the second replaces block encodings in QSVT with randomly sampled unitaries. Both achieve quadratic complexity in d, which we establish as a lower bound for any randomized method implementing polynomial transformations in this model. Finally, as applications, we develop end-to-end quantum algorithms for quantum linear systems and ground state property estimation, achieving near-optimal complexity without oracular access. Our results provide a new framework for quantum algorithms, reducing hardware overhead while maintaining near-optimal performance, with implications for both near-term and fault-tolerant quantum computing.

### [Quantum Seminar] Kishor Bharti—[Pseudorandom quantum authentication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00951)

<!-- <img align="left" width="140" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db048bbd-b64f-4065-8cde-0029af4d164e" /> -->

We introduce the pseudorandom quantum authentication scheme (PQAS), an efficient method for encrypting quantum states that relies solely on the existence of pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs). The scheme guarantees that for any eavesdropper with quantum polynomial-time (QPT) computational power, the encrypted states are indistinguishable from the maximally mixed state. Furthermore, the receiver can verify that the state has not been tampered with and recover the original state with asymptotically unit fidelity. Our scheme is cost-effective, requiring only polylogarithmic circuit depth and a single shared key to encrypt a polynomial number of states. Notably, the PQAS can potentially exist even without quantum-secure one-way functions, requiring fundamentally weaker computational assumptions than semantic classical cryptography. Additionally, PQAS is secure against attacks that plague protocols based on QPT indistinguishability from Haar random states, such as chosen-plaintext attacks (CPAs) and attacks that reveal meta-information such as quantum resources. We relate the amount of meta-information that is leaked to quantum pseudoresources, giving the concept a practical meaning. As an application, we construct important cryptographic primitives, such as verifiable pseudorandom density matrices (VPRDMs), which are QPT-indistinguishable from random mixed states while being efficiently verifiable via a secret key, as well as verifiable noise-robust EFI pairs and one-way state generators (OWSGs). Our results establish a new paradigm of quantum information processing with weaker computational assumptions.

In realistic quantum hardware, the noise channel could be more biased towards either X or Z errors, so it is possible to construct fault-tolerant schemes that focus on handling this biased noise. However, the application of certain gates during computation can change this noise bias, which leads to the study of bias-preserving gates, whose properties will be discussed in this talk.

### [Quantum Seminar] Ulysse Chabaud—[Can effective descriptions of bosonic systems be considered complete?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13857)

<img align="left" width="140" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21fd3bb4-c6a0-4d1c-9093-9a81e8e78e7d" />

Bosonic statistics give rise to remarkable phenomena, from the Hong–Ou–Mandel effect to Bose–Einstein condensation, with applications spanning fundamental science to quantum technologies. Modeling bosonic systems relies heavily on effective descriptions: typical examples include truncating their infinite-dimensional state space and restricting their dynamics to a simple class of Hamiltonians, such as polynomials of canonical operators, which are used to define quantum computing over bosonic modes. However, many natural bosonic Hamiltonians do not belong to this simple class, and some quantum effects harnessed by bosonic computers inherently require infinite dimensional spaces, questioning the validity of such effective descriptions of bosonic systems. How can we trust results obtained with such simplifying assumptions to capture real effects? 
Driven by the increasing importance of bosonic systems for quantum technologies, we solve this outstanding problem by showing that these effective descriptions do in fact capture the relevant physics of bosonic systems. Our technical contribution is twofold: firstly, we prove that any physical, bosonic unitary evolution can be strongly approximated by a finite-dimensional unitary evolution; secondly, we show that any finite-dimensional unitary evolution can be generated exactly by a bosonic Hamiltonian that is a polynomial of canonical operators. Beyond their fundamental significance, our results have implications for classical and quantum simulations of bosonic systems, they provide universal methods for engineering bosonic quantum states and Hamiltonians, they show that polynomial Hamiltonians do generate universal gate sets for quantum computing over bosonic modes, and they lead to an infinite-dimensional Solovay–Kitaev theorem.

Causal inequalities are device-independent constraints on correlations realizable via local operations under the assumption of definite causal order between these operations. While causal inequalities in the bipartite scenario require nonclassical resources within the process-matrix framework for their violation, there exist tripartite causal inequalities that admit violations with classical resources. The tripartite case puts into question the status of a causal inequality violation as a witness of nonclassicality, i.e., there is no a priori reason to believe that quantum effects are in general necessary for a causal inequality violation. Here we propose antinomicity as a notion of nonclassicality for correlations in the presence of indefinite causality and prove strict inclusions between correlation sets classified by their antinomicity. This article provides a causal perspective on antinomicity, complementing the device-independent perspective adopted in arXiv:2411.11397. Besides providing important background to the results reported in arXiv:2411.11397, including proofs of key technical results, we also define a weight-based measure for the antinomicity of correlations that we term the antinomy weight of a correlation. We then investigate antinomic correlations in bipartite and tripartite scenarios with binary settings and outcomes. In doing so, we discover antinomic correlations that are impossible in the process-matrix framework.

While separable states are essentially alike, multipartite entangled states exhibit a rich diversity of structures. One notable form of such entanglement is m-uniformity, whose extremal case—absolutely maximally entangled (AME) states—has been studied across various domains, including quantum cryptography, quantum error correction, and holography.

In this talk, we explore how n-qubit, m-uniform states correspond to [[n,0,m+1]]-distance quantum codes. We then introduce a method for "teleporting" information into a set of quantum registers. By combining these ideas, we construct [[n,k,m+1]] quantum codes and derive bounds relating the parameters n, k, and m. <sup>[[1]](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.108.022426),[[2]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10591769),[[3]](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VQ89UiaoFFwSp0seL_CuttrqH67_3KJP?usp=sharing)</sup>

### [Quantum Visitor/Informal Talk] Venkata Koppula—Verification and Delegation of (Quantum) Computation

<img align="left" width="140" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31cde43a-b4aa-4233-9885-a8c587fd1adf" />

Abstract: Consider a resource-bounded client that wants to outsource some computation C to a powerful server. The client might want the following desirable features: 

(a) Verifiability - some proof that the server has indeed performed the computation C <br/>
(b) Blind Delegation - the server performs the computation without learning anything about C

I will briefly discuss how these properties can achieved in the classical setting (where both client and server are classical, but the server is more powerful than the client). Next, I will discuss some recent progress for these questions in the quantum setting, where the server is quantum, and the client is classical. Both these problems can be solved using a single cryptographic tool. No crypto background will be assumed for this talk.

  ### Achim Kempf—Encrypted Qubits can be Cloned 
We show that encrypted cloning of unknown quantum states is possible. Any number of encrypted clones of a qubit can be created through a unitary transformation, and each of the encrypted clones can be decrypted through a unitary transformation. The decryption of an encrypted clone consumes the decryption key, i.e., only one decryption is possible, in agreement with the no-cloning theorem. A possible application of encrypted cloning is to enable encrypted quantum multi-cloud storage. Beyond applications in cryptography, encrypted cloning could provide a form of redundancy, parallelism, fault tolerance or scalability where direct duplication is forbidden by the no-cloning theorem.
